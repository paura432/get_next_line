# get_next_line

**get_next_line** is a function used to read a line from a file descriptor, typically for handling input from files or standard input. It reads up to the newline character or the end of the file and returns the line as a string. This function is commonly utilized in C programming for efficiently reading lines of text.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: To read a single line from a file descriptor.
- **Returns**: A dynamically allocated string containing the next line from the file descriptor, or `NULL` if the end of the file is reached or an error occurs.
- **Usage**: Useful in scenarios where you need to process data line by line, such as reading configuration files or processing text files.

## Function Prototype


```c
char *get_next_line(int fd);
```

## Parameters

**get_next_line** is a function used to read a line from a file descriptor, typically for handling input from files or standard input. It reads up to the newline character or the end of the file and returns the line as a string. This function is commonly utilized in C programming for efficiently reading lines of text.

- **fd**: The file descriptor from which to read. This can be a file opened with `open()`, or standard input (stdin) with file descriptor `0`.

## Behavior

- **Reads**: The function reads data from the file descriptor up to a newline character (`'\n'`) or end-of-file (EOF).
- **Allocates Memory**: It allocates memory for the line that is read. The caller is responsible for freeing this memory.
- **Handles Multiple Lines**: Subsequent calls to `get_next_line` will return the next line in the file, until EOF is reached.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles cases where the file is empty or contains only a partial line.

## Example Usage

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include "get_next_line.h"

int main(void)
{
    int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char *line;

    if (fd < 0)
        return (1);

    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL)
    {
        printf("%s", line);
        free(line);
    }

    close(fd);
    return (0);
}
